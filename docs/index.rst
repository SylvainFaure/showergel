Welcome to Showergel's documentation!
=====================================

Showergel is made to live aside Liquidsoap_:
while a Liquidsoap script creates a radio stream,
Showergel provides complementary features like logging or occasional scheduling,
with a (minimalist) Web interface.
It is made to run on a Linux box (with systemd) dedicated to your radio stream.

.. note::

    With Showergel you still have to write/tune the Liquidsoap script that will fit your radio.
    That is, the set of sources (
    `playlist <https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/reference.html#playlist>`_,
    `input.harbor <https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/reference.html#input.harbor>`_,
    ...)
    and operators (
    `random <https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/reference.html#random>`_,
    `switch <https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/reference.html#switch>`_,
    `fallback <https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/reference.html#fallback>`_,
    ...)
    that fits your programs and schedule.
    This documentation only provide a starter script,
    covering Liquidsoap's basics and Showgel's integration.

Design principles
-----------------

Showergel is meant for community and benevolent radios.
Therefore we'll keep it small and simple:

* Showergel is intended to run on the same machine as Liquidsoap.
* The REST/Web interface is served by the Bottle_ framework,
  because it's enough and allows keeping everything in a single process.
* Showergel's data is stored in SQLite_ because its architecture fits perfectly
  our use case (everything in a single, local file).
* Scheduling is delegated to APScheduler_, who also needs SQLAlchemy_ to
  access SQLite, so we use SQLAlchemy too.
* Showergel will not hold your music and shows collection.
  For that matter we suggest Beets_,
  you can find examples of its integration with Liquidsoap in
  `Liquidsoap documentation <https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/beets.html>`_.
