Welcome to Showergel's documentation!
=====================================

Showergel is made to live aside Liquidsoap_:
while a Liquidsoap script creates a radio stream,
Showergel provides complementary features like logging or occasional scheduling,
with a (minimalist) Web interface.
It is made to run on a Linux box (with systemd) dedicated to your radio stream.
