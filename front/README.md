# Front-end development

The front-end is written in JavaScript packed with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/),
with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)' [single-file components](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-component.html).
We use the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS Framework.

A fully-working HTML/JS/CSS build is included in this repository.
To modify the front-end, you must beforehand install Yarn and [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/),
then run `yarn install` from the repository root.
Start the live-building server with `yarn serve`.
When you're done, run `yarn build` and commit modifications in the `/showergel/www/` folder.
